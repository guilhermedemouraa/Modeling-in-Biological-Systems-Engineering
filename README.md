# Modeling in Biological Systems Engineering
Finite Differences and Finite Element Analsys to model and evaluate biological processes 

### Purpose

You will find in this repository examples of Modeling in Biological Systems Engineering inspired by my educational experience at UC Davis.

#### Disclaimer:

While every attempt has been made to accurately present the models and their solutions,  they have not been verified independently and some typographical and/or technical errors may be present due to the type of assumptions made. In any case, the author (Guilherme De Moura Araujo) hopes that these models and solutions will be a helpful guide and assist in making further improvements as necessary.

The homework problems you will find in this repository are directly taken from course assignments with the instructorâ€™s consent
