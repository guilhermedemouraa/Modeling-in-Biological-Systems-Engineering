### Study of heat transfer in an orange during the cooling process - Analytical Solution

#### Summary of tasks:
a) Using MATLAB evaluate temperature distribution within the fruit during harvest and during cold storage. Plot the temperature as a function of radius of the fruit.
- Ambient Temperature at Harvest: 26.7 °C
- Density of orange: 998 kg/m3
- Specific heat of orange: 3900 J/kg/°C
- Storage temperature = 3 °C
- Radius of the fruit = 0.036 m
- Heat production due to respiration = 4.71 + 3.55 * Temperature (°C), J/(s-m3)
- Thermal conductivity of fruit = 0.47 W/m/˚C
- Convective heat transfer coefficient at the fruit surface = 6 W/m2/˚C

b) Determine the amount of heat that needs to be removed from the orange to keep it at its steady state temperature when the cold storage is held at 3°C.

c) Extend these results to say 600 bins of fruits each containing 500 kg of fruits. How could an engineer use this model to design a cold storage facility
(consider initial cooling and keeping the storage temperature at steady state)?
