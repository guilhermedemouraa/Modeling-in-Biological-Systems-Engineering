### - Study of heat transfer in an orange fruit using finite differences and Matlab pdepe

#### Summary tasks:
a) Using MATLAB evaluate temperature distribution within the fruit during harvest and during cold storage. Plot the temperature as a function of radius of the fruit.
- Ambient Temperature at Harvest: 26.7 °C
- Density of orange: 998 kg/m3
- Specific heat of orange: 3900 J/kg/°C
- Storage temperature = 3 °C
- Radius of the fruit = 0.036 m
- Heat production due to respiration = 4.71 + 3.55 * Temperature (°C), J/(s-m3)
- Thermal conductivity of fruit = 0.47 W/m/˚C
- Convective heat transfer coefficient at the fruit surface = 6 W/m2/˚C

### - Study of mass and heat transfer in a bioreactor

A 6 cm radius and 35 cm long flexiglass cylinder is loaded with biomass at 50% humidity on a dry basis and inoculated with Aspergillus niger. A water jacket at
a constant temperature of 35 °C surrounds the cylindrical face (See Figure 1). Develop a model to describe the temperature variation and the microorganism
concentration within the bioreactor.
