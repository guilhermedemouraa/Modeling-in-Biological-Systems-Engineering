### Study of mass transfer in a peanut butter cup - Analytical Solution

#### Summary of tasks:
a) Evaluate the peanut oil concentration in peanut butter cup with time, if peanut butter cup is assumed cylindrical in geometry and has a height of 18 mm
with a 12 mm layer of peanut butter in the middle. Assume that the diffusivity of the lipid in liquid medium is 5.5^10-15 m2/s and the initial concentration
of peanut oil in peanut butter layer is 18%.

c) Also plot the concentration of peanut oil at times 0, 1, 3, and 5 years on a single 2-D (concentration versus position) plot.
